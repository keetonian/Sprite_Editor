##Sprite Editor


For now, I'll add a TODO list:

1. Make this readme into a real readme
2. File system- did we want the code one step closer to the top of the repo, that is, get rid of one containing folder?
3. Name of the project- get rid of the A6, somehow. I could look into it on Qt soon.
4. Get to work on doing a few new things in the sprite editor.
